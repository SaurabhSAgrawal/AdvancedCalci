CALCULATOR

Saurabh Sanjay Agrawal 111403002

I have made a calculator using GTK library for graphics. 
GTK library is must to run this project.
(Type 'make' and then './project' to run this project)
To install GTK library, this command on terminal can be used:
      sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
This calculator can calculate any integer infix expression. It can calculate factorial, some trigonometric functions, natural logarithm, modulus, square and square root of an integer.
I have used STACK as a data structure for the building of infix.
